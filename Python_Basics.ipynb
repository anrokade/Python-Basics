    "### 1) What is Python, and why is it popular \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Python Is Popular:\n",
    "1) Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a clear and readable syntax, making it beginner-friendly and suitable for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Versatile Applications: It's used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, game development, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Large Community & Ecosystem: A massive user base contributes to thousands of open-source libraries (like NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, Django), making it easier to build powerful applications quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Cross-Platform: Python code runs on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Strong Support for Integration: It works well with other languages like C/C++ and tools like SQL, Hadoop, and cloud services.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Backed by Industry: Major companies like Google, Netflix, Instagram, and NASA use Python in production."

    "### 2) What is an interpreter in Python \n",
    "  - In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Unlike compiled languages (like C or Java, which are translated into machine code before running), Python code is interpreted directly, meaning it runs as it's read.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the Interpreter Does:\n",
    "1) Reads your .py script or commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Parses the code into bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Executes the bytecode using the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of an Interpreter:\n",
    "1) Faster development: No need to compile before running.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Easier debugging: Errors are caught as they occur, line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Interactive mode: We can test code in real-time using the Python shell or tools like Jupyter Notebook."

    "Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning and purpose in the language. We cannot use them as variable names or identifiers because they are part of Python's syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Python Keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Control Flow -\tif, else, elif, while, for, break, continue, pass\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Boolean/Logic -\tTrue, False, None, and, or, not, is, in\n",

    "Flexibility: You can add, remove, or change elements as needed.\n",

    "Implementation: Internally, lists are implemented to allow resizing and in-place modification.\n",

    "2. Tuples are immutable because:\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples are designed to represent fixed collections (e.g., coordinates, configuration values, dictionary keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety: Immutability ensures data won’t be accidentally changed — useful in multi-threading or when using them as dictionary keys.\n",
